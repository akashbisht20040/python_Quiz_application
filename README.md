# Python Quiz App

This Python Quiz App is a graphical quiz application built using the `tkinter` library. It presents users with multiple-choice questions about Python programming. Each question is timed, and the app provides feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect. Users can see their final score at the end of the quiz.

## Features

- Multiple-choice quiz with embedded Python-related questions.
- Timer for each question (default: 30 seconds).
- Shuffle questions for variety in each quiz session.
- Feedback on answers with correct answers displayed if incorrect.
- Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

## Installation Process

To install and run the Python Quiz App, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Copy or download the script file (e.g., `quiz_app.py`) from the repository or provided source.

2. **Install Python 3.x** (if not already installed):
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python 3.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. During installation, ensure that the **"Add Python to PATH"** option is selected.

3. **Install `tkinter`** (if not already installed):
   - On most systems, `tkinter` is pre-installed with Python. However, if it's not available, you can install it using the following command:
     - **Windows/Linux**:
       ```bash
       sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # On Linux
       ```
     - **macOS**:
       `tkinter` should be included with the default Python installation on macOS.

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script file (`quiz_app.py`) is located.
   - Run the script with the following command:
     ```bash
     python quiz_app.py
     ```

5. **Interact with the Quiz**:
   - The quiz window will open, displaying the first question.
   - Read each question and select an answer by clicking the radio buttons.
   - Click **Next** to move to the next question.
   - Use the **Quit** button to exit the app at any time.

## Code Structure

- **Quiz Data**: Hardcoded questions, options, and answers are embedded directly in the script for simplicity.
- **Timer**: A 30-second countdown timer for each question, which moves to the next question when time runs out.
- **Feedback**: Messages displayed for correct and incorrect answers using `messagebox`.
- **Final Results**: A score summary shown at the end of the quiz.

## GUI Elements

- **Header**: Displays the title of the application.
- **Question Frame**: Shows the current question and options.
- **Options**: Radio buttons for selecting one of four possible answers.
- **Timer**: Countdown timer displayed below the question.
- **Buttons**: "Next" to move to the next question and "Quit" to exit the app.

## Customization

- **Modify Questions**: Edit the `quiz_data` list to add, remove, or change questions.
- **Change Timer Duration**: Adjust the `timer_seconds` variable to set a different time per question.
- **GUI Appearance**: Modify `bg`, `fg`, and font properties to customize the app's look.

## Known Limitations

- Limited to the predefined set of questions.
- No option to resume or save progress mid-quiz.
